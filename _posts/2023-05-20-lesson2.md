In lesson 2, jeremy have show a feature in deep learning which is the `clean()` function. In the example he showed, he built a model to classify the type of bear from the data.
In the first attempt, there is 4 errors reading from the confusion matrix and he used `plot_top_losses` to show the errors.
This is where he introduce the cleaner, allowing the user to read both the training data and valid data by class, and the user can decide whether to keep, delete, or change the class of the image.
This is a powerful tool to allow user to validate the image data by looking and a straight foward way to fix any noises which may affect the performance of the model.

The next part in this lesson, he taught about puuting the model to production using Gardio and Huggingface Spaces. This is a cool way as with a simple export of the model, this can turn into a nice GUI in a few easy steps,
and there are a lot of feature to use which takes a long time to build from scratch, like the search bar he show in the dog or cat example and the aesthetic interface. 

Thats my little learning summary in this lesson!
