I have finally done my first task with fastai. This takes a long time wiht the issue with duckduckgo search wassn't working for searching multiple times, but glad they finally fixed that issue.
I can finish this task and the result seems to be nice with 89.71% accuracy in the first attempt. 
Here is the result!
