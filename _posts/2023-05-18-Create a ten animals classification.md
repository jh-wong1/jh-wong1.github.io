I have finally done my first task with fastai. The task is to classify ten animals with the first example in fastai. This takes a long time as there is an issue with duckduckgo search wasn't working for searching multiple times, but glad they finally fixed that issue.
I can finish this task and the result seems to be nice with 89.71% accuracy in the first attempt. 
Here is the result!
